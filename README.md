# Rule Engine ðŸ“œ

This repository contains a configurable rule engine using [CEL (Common Expression Language)](https://opensource.google/projects/cel) for flexible business logic and validation.

## Features

- **YAML-based configuration** for rules, rulesets, execution policies, and environment overrides
- **CEL expressions** for powerful, type-safe rule logic
- **Customizable error handling and logging** 
- **Environment-specific overrides** for development and production

## Example: Defining Rules

Rules are defined in `rules.yml` under the `rules:` section.  
Example:

```yaml
rules:
  age_validation:
    name: "Age Validation"
    description: "Validates user age requirements"
    expression: "user.age >= globals.min_age"

  email_format:
    name: "Email Format Check"
    description: "Validates email format using regex"
    expression: "user.email.matches(\"^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$\")"
```

## Example: Combining Rules

Rulesets allow you to combine multiple rules using logical operators:

```yaml
rulesets:
  user_registration:
    name: "User Registration Validation"
    description: "All rules must pass for successful registration"
    combination_type: "AND" # OR is allowed, default is AND
    rules:
      - age_validation
      - email_format
      - user_status
```

## Execution Policies

Control how rules are executed:

```yaml
execution_policies:
  fail_fast:
    name: "Fail Fast Execution"
    stop_on_failure: true

  collect_all:
    name: "Collect All Results"
    stop_on_failure: false
    collect_errors: true
```

## Error Handling

Customize error handling and logging:

```yaml
error_handling:
  default_policy: "fail"
  log_level: "INFO"
  custom_error_messages:
    age_validation: "User must be at least 18 years old"
    email_format: "Please provide a valid email address"
```

## Environment Overrides

Override globals and policies per environment:

```yaml
environments:
  development:
    globals:
      min_age: 13
    execution_policies:
      default: "collect_all"

  production:
    globals:
      min_age: 18
    execution_policies:
      default: "fail_fast"
    error_handling:
      log_level: "ERROR"
```

## Usage

1. Edit `rules.yml` to define your rules and policies.
2. Run the rule engine according to your projects instructions.
3. Check logs and error messages for validation results.

For more details, see the comments in `rules.yml` or consult the CEL documentation.
